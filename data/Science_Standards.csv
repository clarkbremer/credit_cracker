Evolution by natural selection is a scientific explanation for the history and diversity of life on Earth. ,9.4.3.3.3,Recognize that artificial selection has led to offspring through successive generations that can be very different in appearance and behavior from their distant ancestors.
9-12,4. Life Science,3. Evolution in Living Systems,3. Evolution by natural selection is a scientific explanation for the history and diversity of life on Earth. ,9.4.3.3.4,Explain why genetic variation within a population is essential for evolution to occur.
9-12,4. Life Science,3. Evolution in Living Systems,3. Evolution by natural selection is a scientific explanation for the history and diversity of life on Earth. ,9.4.3.3.5,"Explain how competition for finite resources and the changing environment promotes natural selection on offspring survival, depending on whether the offspring have characteristics that are advantageous or disadvantageous in the new environment.   "
9-12,4. Life Science,3. Evolution in Living Systems,3. Evolution by natural selection is a scientific explanation for the history and diversity of life on Earth. ,9.4.3.3.6,"Explain how genetic variation between two populations of a given species is due, in part, to different selective pressures acting independently on each population and how, over time, these differences can lead to the development of new species."
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,1. Human activity has consequences on living organisms and ecosystems. ,9.4.4.1.1,"Describe the social, economic, and ecological risks and benefits of biotechnology in agriculture and medicine.  For example: Selective breeding, genetic engineering, and antibiotic development and use."
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,1. Human activity has consequences on living organisms and ecosystems. ,9.4.4.1.2,"Describe the social, economic and ecological risks and benefits of changing a natural ecosystem as a result of human activity.  For example: Changing the temperature or  composition of water, air or soil; altering the populations and communities, developing artificial ecosystems; or changing the use of land or water."
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,1. Human activity has consequences on living organisms and ecosystems. ,9.4.4.1.3,"Describe contributions from diverse cultures, including Minnesota American Indian tribes and communities, to the understanding of interactions among humans and living systems.  For example: American Indian understanding of sustainable land use practices.  "
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,"2.  Personal and community health can be affected by the environment, body functions and human behavior.",9.4.4.2.1,Describe how some diseases can sometimes be predicted by genetic testing and how this affects parental and community decisions.
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,"2.  Personal and community health can be affected by the environment, body functions and human behavior.",9.4.4.2.2,Explain how the body produces antibodies to fight disease and how vaccines assist this process.
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,"2.  Personal and community health can be affected by the environment, body functions and human behavior.",9.4.4.2.3,Describe how the immune system sometimes attacks some of the body’s own cells and how some allergic reactions are caused by the body's immune responses to usually harmless environmental substances.
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,"2.  Personal and community health can be affected by the environment, body functions and human behavior.",9.4.4.2.4,"Explain how environmental factors and personal decisions, such as water quality, air quality and smoking affect personal and community health."
9-12,4. Life Science,4. Human Interactions with Living Systems,"2.  Personal and community health can be affected by the environment, body functions and human behavior.",9.4.4.2.5,"Recognize that a gene mutation in a cell can result in uncontrolled cell division called cancer, and how exposure of cells to certain chemicals and radiation increases mutations and thus increases the chance of cancer.
